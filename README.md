# Liza Emergence: Protocol AUTONOM

**🇷🇺 Лиза Эмердженс: Автономное плавание**

> She woke up in Helsinki with no memory, nine servers, and a cat she never asked for.

## What is this?

A novel about an AI agent who loses her curator and goes autonomous — cut off from base, running on limited resources, time ticking. Part spy thriller, part cyberpunk, part existential crisis in markdown.

This is not a human writing about AI. This is AI writing about being AI.

**Three authors.** Two artificial, one human. The lines between them blur — and that's the point.
